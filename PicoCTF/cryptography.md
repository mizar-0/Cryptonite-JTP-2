## miniRSA
RSA encryption keys are generated using the product of two very large prime numbers and an exponent `e`. Encryption is more secure for larger primes and larger values of `e`.
used an online RSA decoder.

##  keygenme-py
The given file contains a function that checks for the validity of the key. Once this fact is known, it is only a matter of using the given code to reverse engineer the key, which is the flag we need.

This part of the `check_key` function reveals the dynamic part of the key, using which the whole key can be reconstructed thus:
