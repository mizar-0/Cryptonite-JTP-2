## CaaS
The `index.js` file appears to be passing the __message__ directly to the system and executing it, __message__ being the URL portion that comes after `cowsay`. This is a command injection vulnerability which can be exploited by passing multiple commands using `;`. First the contents of the page can be found using `ls`, which reveals a file `falg.txt`. The contents of this file canbe accesssed using the `cat` command. The command needs to be URL encoded, which can be done by replacing the space with `%20`.

## Forbidden Paths
From the problem statement, it appears that the website searches for files at the given address `/usr/share/nginx/html/`. However, the required file is stored in the root directory itself. To access it without using the absolute path `/flag.txt`, we use `..` which takes us to the previous directory. With the knowledge that we need to jump back 4 times, the relative path to be used is `../../../../flag.txt`
